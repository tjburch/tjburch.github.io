# About

I'm a Senior Data Analyst working in baseball research and development with the Boston Red Sox. I now work on our Player Evaluation team, after spending my first handful of years working in Baseball Sciences.

Formerly, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Argonne National Laboratory where I worked to develop simulation and machine learning for particle physics on the first US exascale computer, Aurora.

In my Ph.D I worked on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. My analysis was studying di-Higgs production - rare interactions that result in the production of 2 Higgs bosons. My work heavily focused on studying the Vector Boson Fusion production mode. I additionally worked on developing machine learning techniques to classify photons in the electromagnetic calorimeter as a DOE's SCGSR Fellow. Last, I worked on the FastTracKer upgrade experiment, developing online and offline software, as well as testing and commissioning a massively parallel hardware tracker.

In my free time, I enjoy music (particularly jazz), baking bread, and running. For more information on all of these, feel free to check out the blog component of this page.
