				I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Argonne National Laboratory currently working to develop simulation and machine learning for particle physics on the upcoming Aurora supercomputer, the first US exascale computer.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my Ph.D I worked on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. I was invovled in several capacities. My analysis was studying di-Higgs production - rare interactions that result in the production of 2 Higgs bosons. My work heavily focused on studying the Vector Boson Fusion production mode. I additionally worked on developing machine learning techniques to classify photons in the electromagnetic calorimeter as a DOE's SCGSR Fellow. Last, I worked on the FastTracKer upgrade experiment, developing online and offline software, as well as testing and commissioning a massively parallel hardware tracker.

				In my free time, I enjoy watching sports and studying baseball. I love music, particularly jazz, and got a music minor during my undergraduate studies focusing on guitar. Recently I've been learning how to bake, and have taken a liking to trying out many different bread recipes. For more information on all of these, feel free to check out the blog component of this page.
