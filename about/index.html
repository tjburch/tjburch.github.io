				I'm a graduate student at Northern Illinois University currently working to complete my PhD in particle physics. My research is on the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.
			</p>
			<p>

				Specifically, I study di-Higgs production - rare interactions that result in the production of 2 Higgs bosons. This area of study is particularly interesting as it gives us a direct look into the Higgs self-coupling, the Higgs field interactions with itself. 
			</p>
			<p>

				Furthermore, I've been working on improving photon identification in ATLAS, attempting to apply modern machine learning techniques to better discriminate real photons coming from the interaction of interest from fake photons, generally a product of jet hadronization. Most recently, I have been conducting this work at Argonne National Laboratory through the DOE's SCGSR program.

				From 2015 - 2018, I worked on an upgrade project for ATLAS, the FastTracKer (FTK). This is a massively parallel hardware upgrade designed to offload work on the High Level Trigger by supplying it with tracking information. I was involved in studying the simulation from 2015-2017 (as my authorship qualification task), and with integration, testing, and online software during my time at CERN from Spring 2017 to Fall 2018.

				In my free time, I enjoy watching sports and studying baseball. I love music, particularly jazz, and got a music minor during my undergraduate studies focusing on guitar. Recently I've been learning how to bake, and have taken a liking to trying out many different bread recipes. For more information on all of these, feel free to check out the blog component of this page.
