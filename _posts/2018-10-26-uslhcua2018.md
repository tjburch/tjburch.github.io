excerpt: "Or: how to summarize a PhD's worth of work in 8 minutes"

This past week I've got the chance to speak at Fermilab during the annual US LHC Users Association Meeting. This meeting is a fun opportunity to hear US contributions to all the LHC experiments. 

In particular, there's "lightning round" talks, in which graduate students give short, 8 minute talks over a topic, with 2 minutes afterwards for questions. I participated in this session, giving a talk titled "Why do we care about di-Higgs Production," an attempt to explain the motivation behind the di-Higgs searches at ATLAS and highlighting some of the recent results, particularly the recent result combining the ùõæùõæbb, bbœÑœÑ, and bbbb channels, setting the best ever limits on the Higgs self-coupling parameter.
