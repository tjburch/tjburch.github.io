### _Filterworld: How Algorithms Flattened Culture_ - Kyle Chayka

I appreciated the thesis of this book, analyzing how recommender systems reward bite-sized and easily palatable content. By promoting this type of content, depth, self-exploration, and taste are often compromised. However, the text could have been summed up by just the last chapter, and stretched out to 300 pages, feeling more the dissertation of a recovering social media addict, diving into long anecdotes that add minimal additional insight, just add to the word count. All-in-all, it's a fantastic blog post extended into a repetitive book. 5/10.
