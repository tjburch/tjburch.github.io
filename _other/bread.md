I've recently developed an interest in bread baking in my (always copious) spare time. For now, I've created this post as a single one to aggregate my collection of my best bread pictures and links to my favorite recipes. Eventually I might flesh these out into individual posts. All images on this are my own bakes :)

## Asiago Parmesan Ciabatta 

This is absolutely my favorite recipe to make, found [here](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/asiago-ciabatta-recipe). I follow it almost to the letter, using sprinkle parmesan, along with extra asiago to top it. Also, I like to top it with cream cheese while serving.

## Bagels

This bagel recipe I got from a [great video by Joshua Weissman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8j-ZUp7KD0). This recipe is awesome, and I highly recommend it. I like to top with Everything but the Bagel seasoning from Trader Joe's, rather than going through the stress of making it myself.

## Sourdough Pretzels

I use the [King Arthur recipe](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/sourdough-pretzels-recipe) here, but don't do the recommended malt coating. Instead I boil water and add baking soda, then let each pretzel boil in it for 2 minutes, flipping halfway through. Here, again, I top with Everything but the Bagel.

## Sourdough Loaves

Last, here's a couple images of the sourdough loaves I've made. Generally, I try to follow the recipes out of [Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007SGLZH6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). My starter is 50% white, 50% rye. I fluctuate the hydration, generally try to keep it around 75%.
